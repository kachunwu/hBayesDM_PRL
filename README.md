# hBayesDM_PRL
This is the R code I used to fit different versions of reinforcement learning models and compared their fit index to determine the model used to estimate the parameters for each participants. The estimates were used as the regressors of the linear model of EEG signals.

## Models
1. Win-Stay-Loss-Switch Model (prl_wsls_multipleB)
2. Rescorla-Wagner Model (prl_delta_multipleB)
3. Fictitious Update Model (prl_fictitious_multipleB)
4. Reward-Punishment Model (prl_rp_multipleB)
5. Reward-Punishment Fictitious Update Model (prl_fictitious_rp_multipleB)
